# My Arch Setup:
My arch setup for new computers. Includes my personal dotfile and scripts as well.
I nicked name this setup: "Kool"

This setup is supposed to be:
- Fast & Minimalist
- Cool

## Note:
This is only for people who've installed (Arch) Linux and want a basic setup.
However, this repo exists to serve me personally, but you clone it if you want.

## Usage:
Copy the Repo, and run the "install_setup.sh" script in "scripts", and finally copy over the "home" folder to your
home directory with: *sudo cp -rf ./home/. ~/*
Also beware of the setup you chose to install.
