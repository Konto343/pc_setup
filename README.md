# My Arch Setup:
My arch setup for new computers. Includes my personal dotfile and scripts as well.

## Note:
This is only for people who've installed (Arch) Linux and want a basic setup.
However, this repo exists to serve me personally, but you clone it if you want.

## Usage:
Copy the Repo, and run the "install_setup.sh" script, and finally copy over the "home" folder to your
home directory with: 
sudo cp -rf ./home/. ~/
